Description

This dataset represents sensor events collected in the WSU Tulum
smart apartment testbed during the 2009-2010 academic year.
The apartment housed two married residents
at this time and they performed their normal daily activities.

File format

One data file is included in this release.  Sixteen activities are annotated
by denoting the begin and end of activity occurrence.

The sensors consist of 31 motion sensors (M001 through M031) and
five temperature sensors (T001 through T005).
The sensor layout of the Tulum apartment is shown in the file
